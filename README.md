This project represents a spinoff to one of Jonas Schmedtman's class projects of his popular [https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/](Advanced CSS class). 
It incorporates nice visualizations as well ass a scalable SCSS structure for larger CSS projects. I hope you like my spin of it. Thanks to Jonas Schmedtmann for the inspiration!!
